        <h2>Daunte Robertson</h2> 
        <p>My name is Daunte Robertson, I am a  Computer Science major at UWI and in the future id like to go into Robotics,
	 mainly the software section because I like when I can do something intangible and notice a tangible result. 
	 I am a quiet person who tends to think alot about things, I try to look at situations from different perspectives to 
	 try and understand the same idea from different views.I am interested in web development because it seemed like an
	 interesting topic and i'd like to explore what it has to offer.</p>
